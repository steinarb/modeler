* An eclipse GEF-based graphical modeler with Neo4J as storage
** Overview
** Development status
** Building locally
I'm only giving the instructions for how to install on debian or ubuntu or similar (e.g. mint) GNU/linux systems.

Figuring out the commands for how to install the software on non-APT GNU/linux systems, macs or windows boxes, are left as an exercise for the reader (but the same software packages are required for development).

*** Prerequites
**** git and maven
All commands below are shown run as root on debian.  Prefix the commands with sudo if running on ubuntu.

Instructions:
 1. Install git, on a debian/ubuntu GNU/linux distribution, this is done by giving the following command as root:
    : apt install git
 2. Install java SDK, on a debian/ubuntu GNU/linux distribution, this is done by giving the following command as root:
    : apt install openjdk-11-jdk
 3. Install maven, on a debian/ubuntu GNU/linux distribution, this is done by giving the following command as root:
    : apt install maven
**** Eclipse and tycho

The eclipse packaged by debian is too old and buggy to use.

Instead, follow the instructions below (should work for all GN/linux distros).  All commands are run as a regular user.

 1. Clone the modeler project:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      cd $HOME
      mkdir -p workspaces/ws01
      cd workspaces/ws01
      git clone https://github.com/steinarb/modeler.git
    #+END_EXAMPLE
 2. Download the eclipse installer:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      cd /tmp
      wget https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/eclipse//oomph/epp/2019-06/R/eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz
    #+END_EXAMPLE
    1. For windows or mac, download and run the appropriate installer from  https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer
 3. Unpack and start the installer:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      cd /tmp
      tar xvfz eclipse-inst-linux64.tar.gz
      cd eclipse-installer
      ./eclipse-inst
    #+END_EXAMPLE

**** Neo4J server

The modeller need a Neo4J server.

For installing on other systems than debian based GNU/linux systems, see [[https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/][the Neo4J documentation]].

For [[https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/linux/debian/#debian-add-repository][installing on debian or ubuntu]], do:
 1. Add the Neo4J APT repository, do the following commands as root:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      wget -O - https://debian.neo4j.org/neotechnology.gpg.key | apt-key add -
      echo 'deb https://debian.neo4j.org/repo stable/' | tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neo4j.list
      apt update
    #+END_EXAMPLE
 2. Install neo4j community edition:
    #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      echo "neo4j-enterprise neo4j/question select I ACCEPT" | debconf-set-selections
      echo "neo4j-enterprise neo4j/license note" | debconf-set-selections
      apt install neo4j=1:3.5.8
    #+END_EXAMPLE
